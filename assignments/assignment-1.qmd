Three Differences Between R and Python

-   In R, we use the `<-` operator to assign values to variables. In Python, we use the `=` operator.

    R example: x \<- 5

    Pyhton example: x = 5

-   R uses a syntax where you call functions or methods by specifying the function name followed by parentheses.

    Python, on the other hand, uses dot notation with method calls.

    R example: result \<- mean(data)

    Python example: result = data.mean ()

-   R uses 1-based indexing, meaning the first element of a list or vector is \[1\]. Python, on the other hand, uses 0-based indexing, so the first element is \[0\].

    R example: my_list \[1\]

    Python example: my_list \[0\]
