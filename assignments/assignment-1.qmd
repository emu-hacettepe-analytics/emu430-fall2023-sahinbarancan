# Assignment 1

My first assignment has three parts..

## (a)

## (b)

Three Differences Between R and Python

-   In R, we use the `<-` operator to assign values to variables. In Python, we use the `=` operator.

    R example: x \<- 5

    Pyhton example: x = 5

-   R uses a syntax where you call functions or methods by specifying the function name followed by parentheses.

    Python, on the other hand, uses dot notation with method calls.

    R example: result \<- mean(data)

    Python example: result = data.mean ()

-   R uses 1-based indexing, meaning the first element of a list or vector is \[1\]. Python, on the other hand, uses 0-based indexing, so the first element is \[0\].

    R example: my_list \[1\]

    Python example: my_list \[0\]

## (c)

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(na_example)
print(na_example)
head(na_example)
is.na(na_example)
goal <- na_example     #I was watching football match when I did it.
goal[is.na(na_example)] <- 0 
print(goal)
number_of_na <- sum(goal == 0)
print(number_of_na)
```
